                                        Android is one the largest OSs being used by mobile users all over the world. Therefore, from utility...						<span>Read more</span></p>
                                    </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <h4>Personalized UI</h4>
                                    <p>With Android 12, Google is unveiling a whole new design language called <a target="_blank" href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you" rel="noopener">Material</a><a target="_blank" href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you" rel="noopener"> </a><a target="_blank" href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you" rel="noopener">You</a> &mdash; the next stage for Material Design. The primary idea behind Material You is that the design should be directly influenced by the users.</p>
                                    <p>According to its website, <em>&ldquo;Material You explores </em><strong><em>a more humanistic approach to design</em></strong><em>. One that celebrates the tension between design sensibility and personal preference, and does not shy away from emotion&rdquo;. </em>That means, your device gets auto-customized for providing a more personalized experience in Android 12.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Using color extraction, the system will pick up colors from your wallpaper and apply the colors across the entire operating system including the lock screen, notification bar, volume control, etc. to give <strong>a customized, unified look</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>This is nothing new for Windows users who have been enjoying a similar feature in Windows since Windows 10. However, it does come as a breath of fresh air for Android fans who have been waiting for this feature for a long time now.</p>
                                    <h4>Notification UI and Quick Settings</h4>
                                    <p>The design for the notification drawer (also known as the notification shade) and the Quick Settings has seen a massive overhaul. It has been modified to improve <strong>esthetics and functionality. </strong></p>
                                    <p>Notifications for a particular app are grouped or separated based on the given app and the notification. Also, you can easily <strong>snooze a particular notification</strong> with one tap from the notification drawer.</p>
                                    <p>The Quick Settings menu and notification drawer will also no longer show the small round toggles. Instead, they are replaced with much <strong>larger, rectangular controls</strong> for a more at-a-glance view of your notifications, media player, and the settings.</p>
                                    <p>Android 12 also adds <strong>Google Pay and Home Controls</strong> to the settings. This new design lets you control most of the Android OS with a swipe and a tap.</p>
                                   
                                    <h4>Enhanced Features</h4>
                                    <p>Android 12 has improved a lot of everyday features like<strong> one-handed mode, picture-in-picture mode, and double-tap gestures</strong>. The one-handed mode makes using big-screen phones easier by allowing you to pull downwards from the top-half of the display to open the notification drawer the easy way.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Double-tap gestures can be configured</strong> for actions like taking screenshots, launching the assistant, or playing or pausing music, etc. The picture-in-picture mode allows the user to <strong>play media in a small window</strong> on the top of other apps.</p>
                                    <p>Although this feature was available in previous versions of Android, you can <strong>increase the size of the window without going fullscreen</strong> in Android 12.</p>
                                    <h4>Redesigned  Widgets</h4>
                                    <p>Google has given a lot of thought to widgets and widget organization while designing the all-new Android 12. The widgets are now <strong>larger and carry more information.</strong> On top of that, the new widgets are more beautiful than ever.</p>
                                    <p>Moreover, new widgets are also introduced; for example, the<strong> Personal Space widget</strong> that prompts you to be in touch with important people in your life. Android 12 has also improved the organization of widgets. For instance, the <strong>Home Screen can now be customized</strong> with 4&times;5, 4&times;4, 3&times;3, and 2&times;2 grids.</p>
                                   
                                    <h4>Privacy Dashboard</h4>
                                    <p>Android 12&rsquo;s new privacy features advocate <strong>transparency and complete control</strong> over privacy and security of the users. Google has introduced privacy features that help the users access <strong>all apps&rsquo; permissions and privacy settings </strong>directly from a single dashboard, making it easy for all to manage permissions.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>On top of that, an indicator is added on the top-right corner of the screen that tells you when an app accesses the camera or microphone. You can <strong>revoke app permissions</strong> to these sensors easily and quickly from the quick settings.</p>
                                    <p>Android 12 is coming with a brand new development: the <strong><em>Android Private Compute Core</em></strong>. It allows Android to keep your personal information safe by keeping the <strong>information local to your phone</strong> and away from the network. This enhancement in privacy and security can be a game-changer for Android.</p>
                                    <h4>Better Performance</h4>
                                    <p>Do you usually complain about your device&rsquo;s dying battery? Fortunately, Google has addressed the issue of low battery power efficiency in Android 12. Thanks to under-the-hood improvements, <strong>Android 12 achieves better power efficiency</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>Moreover, the <strong>CPU time needed for core system services is reduced by 22%</strong>, and the use of big cores by the system is reduced by 15%. This makes your device faster and more responsive while significantly increasing the battery life.</p>

                                    <p>Android has introduced the <em>Nearby Share</em> option for users to <strong>share Wi-Fi credentials directly with a nearby device</strong>. This was achieved by using a QR code in the previous Android versions.</p>
                                    <p>Although the QR code feature is retained in Android 12, the Nearby Share option makes this process more hassle-free.</p>

                                    <p>Screenshots are another feature that will see changes in the new version of Android. Though it is not a revolutionary change, but it does allow you   directly <strong>edit the screenshots with editing tools</strong>, add text, stickers, or emojis in Android 12.</p>
                                    <p>Another much-awaited feature that Android 12 is bringing to us is the scrolling screenshot. You can take a <strong>scrolling screenshot</strong> instead of having to click multiple screenshots to get the complete screenshot of a scrollable page.</p>
                                    <h4>Android 12 Updates</h4>
                                    <p>Speaking of Android 12 updates, you can now update Android 12 services directly through Google Play. This makes <strong>Android updates easier </strong>by negating the need for full system updates.</p>
                                    <p>What this also means is that you will be able to get <strong>updates more efficiently without the involvement of the device&rsquo;s OEM</strong>.</p>
                                    <h4>Remote Control</h4>
                                    <p>Android 12 devices have the ability to <strong>double up as a remote.</strong> You can now use your device to operate Android OS TVs including Google TV-enabled sets. It might not be an over-the-top feature but it does come in handy at times.</p>
                                    <h4>Bonus features:</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><strong>App Hibernation</strong>: This new feature in Android 12 that will revoke app permissions for unused apps. It also <strong>clears temporary files and cache</strong> for these unused apps to provide more storage space. It helps boost performance on entry-level and/or old-generation devices.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Better Emojis</strong>: Google is introducing <strong>newer, better emojis</strong> in Android 12. These changes are directed towards adding depth and practicality.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Camera Support</strong>: Google has improved support for ultra-high resolution camera sensors to improve <strong>image quality and low-light performance</strong>.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Third-party App Stores</strong>: Android is set to make downloading apps from different app stores easier on its latest version. Android 12 improves <strong>access to multiple app markets</strong> for users, making it easy for everyone.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Bonus features for developers:</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Camera Support:</strong> Google enables support for custom camera effects like bokeh, HDR, etc. introduced by device manufacturers through <strong>vendor extensions in its CameraX library.</strong> Moreover, these vendor extensions are exposed directly for the apps in Android 12, enhancing the camera.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Faster Machine Learning: Google&rsquo;s Neural Network API </strong>helps developers to make full use of ML accelerators. These drivers are directly update-able through Google Play Services outside the platform updates. This allows developers to use the updated drivers on all compatible devices.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rich Haptic Experience:</strong> Google has added extra haptic feedback options. The new APIs can be used by developers for rich haptic effects for <strong>enhancing user interface events, defining complex effects,</strong> etc.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>That is all about most of the novel features in Android 12. Its new design successfully connects with the users&rsquo; emotions &mdash; just like Google aimed with Android 12. It brings several improvements in features, privacy settings, and developer options, making it the best version of Android &mdash; ever available!</p>

<p>Developing applications can be a very stressful job. Nobody is perfect, and running into buggy code is fairly commonplace in this career. Some programmers get angry, frustrated, upset, discouraged even, while others play it cool. <strong>How we handle the process of fixing bugs is worthy of scrutiny.</strong></p>
<p>I want to share a collection of phrases and ideas you&rsquo;ll hear from programmers struggling when fixing their source code. It is all light-hearted humor, triggered when things become stressful. Generally the application will (eventually) work out and you will move onto the next great task.</p>

<p>Going back to old source code from your past brings a temptation to rework larger block clusters. Ugly logic statements with verbose syntax is very hard to read! But then again,<strong> if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.</strong> This is a struggle I often face and it surely plagues a number of other software developers.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I should check Github for a starting framework&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I think most developers know about <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and the amazing open source projects being published every day. Programmers dabbling in all languages join the network to branch off existing projects, add wiki discussions, or make their own code repo. It is an excellent resource for cool plugins and templates to be used on various projects.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Why does this script need so many libraries?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Moving particularly into bigger languages such as Java and Objective-C, the amount of libraries can become fierce. It can be very noticeable when building off of a framework which requires a lot of grounding. Even some plugins for JavaScript will need a myriad of additional files. Sometimes the clutter will get annoying &ndash; but at least it works!</p>

<p><strong>4. &ldquo;There must be a solution somewhere on the Internet.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>My first reaction to a difficult problem is to check the Internet. Lots of programmers will post forum threads about their issues, and they will eventually be solved and archived. Google is fantastic at picking up keywords related to your issue and pointing you in the right direction of these helpful discussion threads. Unfortunately, sometimes there just isn&rsquo;t much information out there on a particular issue.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Is there a plugin for this functionality?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Why reinvent the wheel? <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-plugin-development/">Plugins</a> are a great resource for expanding the user interface of any program or website. Additionally they can offer <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/top-social-bookmarking-wordpress-plugins/">some customization</a> and unique options for the developers to work with. Plus if there isn&rsquo;t already a plugin available, why not build one yourself?</p>
<p class="recommended_top"><strong>Read Also: </strong><a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/wordpress-search-plugin-snippet/">WordPress Search: Useful Plugins And Snippets</a></p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The site works, but I&rsquo;m dreading Internet Explorer.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to mention the trials and tribulations which have come from the history of rendering webpages within Internet Explorer. From version 5.5 up to about IE9-IE10 there has been a constant struggle for <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/complete-guide-to-cross-browser-compatibility-check/">greater browser support</a>. Web developers may fear the debugging of a webpage, opening within IE6 to a rendering nightmare. Thankfully those days are slowly becoming a thing of the past.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;For a logic statement this doesn&rsquo;t seem very logical.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>There are logic statements for if/else loops, for loops, while loops, do loops&hellip; the list is fairly lengthy. When looking over sample code I have relapses trying to figure out how my logic is supposed to work. The sheer number of NOT operators and comparison signs can have your head spinning. I frequently go back to update my own logic for good practice in the future.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;I spent 30 minutes writing a function and 2 hours getting it to work.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the programming story of the decade? You are humming along just fine building what you know, when all of a sudden the function is outputting a fatal error. So now you have to go back removing blocks of code attempting to pinpoint the faulty line number. It can be exhausting yet a relief when you finally find the culprit and solve the case.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;After reading several blog posts, I now realize that I&rsquo;ve been doing this completely wrong the entire time.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I often like to dive head-first into topics with my own programming ideologies but this can lead to trouble down the road when things don&rsquo;t go according to plan. There have been many times where I&rsquo;ve started a project and ran into trouble, seeking blogs and other articles for support. Then I find out the whole method is practically wrong and it&rsquo;d be easier to just start over! Doing a bit of research first will definitely save time in the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;The nice people on Stack Overflow can probably help me.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t begin to count the number of times that I have solved a difficult problem through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. The community is full of nice, intelligent people who are willing to help if you take the first step. Out of all the online forums this is definitely the most widely supported network for software programming and frontend/backend web development.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;All that trouble for a missing closing parenthesis.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Debugging is all about the steps you take. Two steps forward, one step back, two more forward and so forth. The feeling of staring at code for hours just looking for some mistake in function names or variable scope, only to find a missing parenthesis, is a weird feeling. All that time lost over a minor syntax error. The feeling of being both a genius and fool at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Welp, coffee break!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to get up and away from the monitor. After hovering over the keyboard for hours at a time, it definitely helps to break up the routine. Most health guides recommend a break every 30-60 minutes. But it all depends on your needs and if you get annoyed more from stopping for a break in the middle of a program than not.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;I should put this project on hold and deal with it later.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>An alternative to work breaks is <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/creative-working-from-home/">walking away from the project</a> instead of just your computer. Maybe there is other work that needs to be done, so go on over and check that one out instead. This would be a better allocation of time and resources, compared to fretting away while attempting to solve a problem that you&rsquo;ve been looking into for 5 hours straight.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;I wonder if classical music will stimulate my programming abilities.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>There is an idea that classical music could <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090721201129AAv9q2h">promote plant growth</a> during the early stages of life. I personally love classical music for the intricate notes and complex musical theory. Jazz, piano, big band, classy music has a place in human culture around the globe. So could listening to smart music while programming actually make you smarter at debugging? Probably not, but hopefully it wouldn&rsquo;t make you more clumsy either.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Maybe now is a good time for testing the theory of Ballmer&rsquo;s Peak.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I think many readers know about <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ballmer%20Peak">Ballmer&rsquo;s Peak</a> which was coined by a <a href="http://xkcd.com/323/">particular xkcd comic</a>. To simplify, the theory states that programmers hit a peak of coding ability after consuming a specific amount of alcohol. It was attributed to Steve Ballmer for his wacky antics which may be construed as the ramblings of a drunkard although it is somewhat ironic, as Ballmer was never truly a programmer at Microsoft. Guess we willl have to wait for somebody else to give this theory a trial run.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;Was somebody fiddling with my source code?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like delusion and paranoia, but sometimes you just have to wonder who is writing this stuff when you are busy catching up on sleep. Looking over projects from weeks or months in the past can leave you with a sinking feeling. Sometimes you will find stuff that you never remember adding &ndash; even from projects you just looked into last week! I write it off as crazy but you never know&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;I have no idea what any of this means.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The worst situation you can have is looking into source code with absolutely no idea what to do. This may arise from your own projects, or somebody else&rsquo;s project, but it is all the same problem. Now you have to decide whether it is worth spending more time searching for an alternative or dissecting the script to learn how it works.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna need to Google that error message.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>After working in PHP for years I have to say that Google is my best friend when debugging problems. This is definitely the same case with Objective-C, C++, Java, Python, and other major languages. Error messages try to help but unless you have memorized what the different codes mean, it reads more like translated computer language. Thankfully there is a lot of support online for determining just exactly what these error messages really mean.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;I should stop and call it a day&hellip; but I really wanna figure this out!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>We all know that feeling of utter frustration where you want to <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/career-dilemma/">call it quits</a>, but it just feels like giving up isn&rsquo;t the right choice. You want to keep pushing forward and try new solutions for debugging. But what if it turns into a waste of another hour? I am no stranger to this circumstance and it can be awfully disheartening.</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;Oh dear, why didn&rsquo;t I write any comments?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to more basic frontend HTML/CSS/JS there isn&rsquo;t always a need to leave comments. But more complicated scripts and programs will need some type of organization for when you want to look back in a few months, or even after a couple of years. Sometimes you will forget to comment about functions and their parameters, the output format, and other essential data. This will no doubt lead to confusion down the road when bugs start appearing and you have to debug the entire script for a solution. If only there were some helpful comments.</p>
<p><strong>21. &ldquo;This was working 20 minutes ago&hellip;&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Possibly the most frustrating part of building a program is when it goes from working to not working &ndash; without ANY updates to ANY part of the code! I swear it happens. And it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense &ndash; maybe the other program was running a cached version? Then there are times when updating one tiny bit of code will cause the whole program to crash on error and just stop working entirely. Revert back to the most recent working copy and keep moving forward from there.</p>
<p><strong>22. &ldquo;You forget one lousy semicolon and the whole program comes crashing down.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Almost every programming language I have used will require a symbol for line termination. Not all of them do, but it is definitely common in the C/C++ family. When you forget to add one terminating semicolon it is an honest mistake! But the parser doesn&rsquo;t understand this and throws out a fatal error. Now you have to spend another 20 minutes scouring code for a technical fault, when the whole time, it was just missing a semicolon. Ah, the joys of debugging software.</p>
<p><strong>23. &ldquo;I wonder how much it would cost to pay someone to fix my mistakes?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The overwhelming thought of hiring another developer is tempting, but obviously nowhere near financially viable. Plus how would you learn from all of these mistakes if you are not getting your hands dirty? It can feel good when you finally understand a programming concept, after failing multiple times. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop this thought from crossing my mind ever so often.</p>
<p><strong>24. &ldquo;A quick visit to Hacker News is sure to improve my productivity.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>A lot of programmer&rsquo;s favorite choice for social news on software &amp; startups is the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News frontpage</a>. It has a lot of great information about freelancing, time management, software development, plus new startup launches and raising capital. Although HN can emulate the feeling of being productive by educating yourself, it can also be a drain on your time. Taking a quick recess to check up on news every few hours couldn&rsquo;t be all that bad.</p>
<p><strong>25. &ldquo;How can this API have no documentation?!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The most frustrating part about using a plugin or framework with bad documentation is that you have to look deep into the source code yourself. I simply adore projects where the developers will take the time to specifically design a usable documentation page. All the parameters and options are explained, possibly even used within some example code snippets. But sadly this is not always the case. It is easiest to stay away from poorly-documented work and save yourself the grief.</p>
<p><strong>26. &ldquo;I sure hope I&rsquo;ve saved a backup copy of that database&hellip;&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Backups are not always on my mind when writing and debugging code. However, data backups offer a stepping stone to go back in time before certain changes were made. This is especially useful on a live server environment where changes are implemented immediately. Remember to keep local copies of your website files and databases in case of an emergency! It can be an annoying task, but not as annoying as rebuilding a corrupt SQL database.</p>
<p><strong>27. &ldquo;What is the quickest solution to get this working properly?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>After hours of turmoil looking for a custom solution it becomes very clear that you may need a new approach. Programmers want to get the functionality working first before designing a pretty interface around it. Determine the quickest, most accurate solution and implement this to be working at best 100% of the time. Then it is easier moving on to the pretty aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong>28. &ldquo;I bet updating my software will fix the issue.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The teams who manage dependencies and plugins for programming languages do not need to push releases very often. Sometimes updating your PHP/Ruby/Python/SQL version may solve debugging issues when transferring files from your computer onto a live server. Local updates will very rarely help with fixing a bug in your source code, unless your version is hopelessly out of date. Hey it&rsquo;s worth a shot!</p>
<p><strong>29. &ldquo;I should be more organized and study Git&hellip; But I&rsquo;ll look into it next week.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The open source version control package <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is extremely popular among programmers. It offers an easier learning curve than other competitors, and it is used in many online repos such as Github and Bitbucket. Developers will put off the idea because it definitely has a steep entry-level curve for beginners. However once you understand the basic commands then Git is a cakewalk. And it makes the practice of debugging with version control a lot clearer, too.</p>
<p><strong>30. &ldquo;Scrap this, I&rsquo;m starting over from scratch.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes after trying hours of solutions, you just have to move your working files to an archive directory <strong>(or delete them) </strong>and start again from scratch. The decision is tough considering how the previous hours have been toiled away for little payoff. But when I am in a rut, getting a fresh start is often just what I need to see a project through to completion.</p>

<p class="recommended_top"><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note: </strong>This article is part of our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/tag/code-optimization-series/">Code Optimization series</a>, where we take a look at how to optimize coding for better efficiency in a bid to be better coders.</p>
<p>CSS refactoring needs to be an essential part of the front-end development workflow, if we want to have a manageable and optimized code base. When we refactor CSS, we <strong>clean up and reorganize our existing code</strong> without adding any new features or fixing bugs.</p>
<p>Refactoring helps <strong>prevent CSS explosion, improves code readability and reusability</strong>, and <strong>makes CSS sleeker and faster to execute</strong>.</p>
<p>Refactoring is usually needed after a while, as even projects that started out with a concise and organized code base sooner or later begin to lose their clarity; consistency, obsolete rules and duplicate code parts appear; and we also start to override styles and employ more and more hacks and workarounds.</p>
<p>The best way to keep our CSS code base maintainable is to stick to the &ldquo;<em>refactor early, refactor often</em>&rdquo; rule of thumb. In this post we will take a look at some tips about how we can conduct an effective CSS refactoring process.</p>
<h4>1. Conduct an Initial Audit</h4>
<p>To have a better picture about what we need to refactor, it&rsquo;s the best to <strong>start with a comprehensive audit to see what we currently have</strong>.</p>
<p>There are many great online tools that can help us in this endeavour. <a target="_blank" href="http://cssdig.com/">CSSDig</a> is a powerful Chrome extension that analyzes the CSS of a website, and explores its weaknesses, such as too specific selectors or repetitive properties.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://unused-css.com/">Unused CSS</a> investigates unused CSS rules, while linting tools, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a>, make it possible to quickly find compability, maintainability and other issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to manually scrutinize the code during the initial audit, as many problems on the architectural level can only be caught this way.</p>

<h4>2. Set Up a Manageable Plan</h4>
<p>Refactoring working code is always a daunting task, but we can ease the pain if we create a plan about what we need to do, slice up the refactoring process to manageable chunks, and make a feasible schedule.</p>
<p>In CSS refactoring there&rsquo;s a crucial thing we always need take into consideration: some things that we refactor, e.g. changing selector names, will make it <strong>necessary to adjust the code of the relevant HTML and JavaScript files</strong> as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s therefore a good idea to <strong>trace forward these additional modifications we&rsquo;ll need to perform</strong>, and <strong>build them into our refactoring schedule</strong> along with the primary, CSS-related tasks.</p>
<h4>3. Track Progress</h4>
<p>Before embarking on refactoring, it&rsquo;s an essential step to <strong>back up our initial files</strong>. Introducing a version control system, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>, into our workflow can also significantly improve the refactoring process, as we&rsquo;ll have a registry about the sequential steps we&rsquo;ve taken, and we <strong>will be able to return to a previous stage if we want to redo things</strong>.</p>

<h4>4. Stick to a Coding Style Guide</h4>
<p>A coherent coding style guide can remarkably improve code readability and maintainability, so before we start to refactor it&rsquo;s essential to <strong>set up a CSS coding style guide</strong>.</p>
<p>The important things to decide upon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>naming conventions</li>
<li>formatting rules</li>
<li>declaration order</li>
<li>units and values we want to use</li>
<li>commenting rules</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t want to create our own coding style guide, we can also use someone else&rsquo;s, such as ThinkUp&rsquo;s which can found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ThinkUpLLC/ThinkUp/wiki/Code-Style-Guide:-CSS">Github</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not enough though to just introduce a coding style guide, we also need to <strong>stick to it when we rewrite the code</strong> during the refactoring, and <strong>expect the same from everyone else</strong> who works on our project.</p>
<h4>5. Set Up a Coherent File Structure</h4>
<p>After we are ready with the preparations, the first thing we need to do is to set up a proper CSS file structure that pays attention to the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Cascading_and_inheritance">cascading nature</a> of CSS.</p>
<p>It mainly depends on the project how best to organize our files, but there are some universal rules, such as to use a separate <code>normalize.css</code> file for <a target="_blank" href="http://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/">CSS reset</a> styles, a separate <code>global.css</code> for global styles that are used across the whole project, and to store 3rd party libraries in a separate folder.</p>
<p>If we want to play safe with our CSS file structure, there are also ready-made architectures, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss">ITCSS</a>, that offer effective techniques about <strong>how to organize CSS files in a scalable way</strong>.</p>
<p class="recommended_top">Find out what <strong>SMACSS</strong> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/css-writing-methodologies/">CSS Writing Methodologies</a></p>
<h4>6. Get Rid of Unused and Duplicate Rules</h4>
<p>After a while, CSS files usually begin to abound in unused rules that we need to identify and clean out during refactoring. There are many online tools that enable us to <strong>investigate these obsolete rules</strong>, and sometimes also allow us to quickly ditch them.</p>
<p>The best-known tool for this purpose is probably <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giakki/uncss">UnCSS</a>, a Node.js module that makes it possible to get rid of unused CSS rules fast, and it also provides us with sophisticated configuration options that make it easy to fine-tune the cleaning process.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to take into account that we <strong>don&rsquo;t necessarily want to remove unused rules from <em>all</em> the CSS files we have</strong>, for example from global, reset, or 3rd party stylesheets, so we need to <strong>exclude them</strong> while performing the cleaning.</p>
<p>Along with obsolete rules, duplicate rules also lead to superfluous code bloat and performance loss. We can remove them by using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-purge">CSS Purge</a> Node.js module, but we can also work with <strong>CSS linters in order to search for duplicate rules</strong> in our CSS files.</p>
<h4>7. Reduce Specificity</h4>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#specificity">specificity</a> of a CSS selector is calculated from the number and the types of the inner selectors it contains. CSS specificity is expressed as a 4-digit number that&rsquo;s the easiest to understand if we check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://specificity.keegan.st/">visual CSS specifity calculator</a>:</p>

<p>The lowest specificity (<code>0001</code>) belongs to selectors that only target one general HTML element, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. <strong>The more inner selectors a compound selector contains, the higher its specificity is.</strong></p>
<p>Certain selectors, such as <code>id</code> or selectors coming from inline styles, have higher priorities because they override the styles belonging to more generic selectors. For example the specificity of the <code>#id1</code> selector is <code>0100</code>.</p>
<p>In refactoring, the goal is to decrease the specificity of selectors (keep them short) as much as it&rsquo;s possible, as <strong>selectors with higher specificity significantly reduce selector reusability</strong>, and <strong>lead to a bloated code base</strong>.</p>
<p>The 3 main types of high specificity selectors are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Qualified selectors</strong>, such as <code>p.class1</code> (defining the <code>p</code> tag is unnecessary here, as it makes it impossible to use the same class with other HTML elements)</li>
<li><strong>Deeply nested selectors</strong>, such as <code>.class1 .class2 .class3 .class4 ...</code></li>
<li><strong>IDs</strong>, such as <code>#id1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Online tools, like <a target="_blank" href="http://cssdig.com/">CSSDig</a> mentioned in Step 1, can be used to quickly find these high specificity selectors. It can also be useful to set up a rule in the coding style guide about things like the maximum level of nesting, or a limit on using <code>id</code> selectors.</p>
<h4>8. Weed Out <code>!important</code> Rules</h4>
<p>CSS rules followed by the <code>!important</code> statement override regular style rules. Using <code>!important</code> rules sooner or later <strong>lead to incoherent code</strong>. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence most linting tools mark them as error.</p>
<p>When we need to write CSS quickly, we may begin to rely on them though because of their simplicity.</p>
<p>The main problem with <code>!important</code> declarations is that if we want to override them in the future, we need to put even more <code>!important</code> declarations in use, so it&rsquo;s best to weed them out wherever it&rsquo;s possible during the refactoring process.</p>
<h4>9. Clean Out Magic Numbers and Hard Coded Values</h4>
<p>During our everyday CSS workflow, sometimes we bump into issues we can&rsquo;t solve, and we begin to use so-called <strong>magic numbers</strong>, values that work for some reasons but we don&rsquo;t understand why. For instance take the following example:</p>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">
.class1 {
	position: absolute;
	top: 28px;
	left: 15.5%;
}</pre>
<p>The main problem with magic numbers is that they are <strong>circumstantial</strong>, and they embody the &ldquo;programming by permutation&rdquo; antipattern. During the refactoring process we need to remove these arbitrary rules from our code, and replace them with more reasonable solutions wherever it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>The same rule of thumb applies for <strong>hard-coded values</strong> as well. Probably the most frequent occurrence of hard-coded values can be found in line-height rules:</p>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">
/* bad, we'll need to add extra fixed line-height rules 
 to the child elements of .class1 */

.class1 {
	font-size: 20px;
	line-height: 24px;
}

/* good, the flexible line-height rule can be safely 
used by child elements as well */

.class1 {
	font-size: 20px;
	line height: 1.2;
}</pre>
<p>Hard-coded values make our code less future-proof and more rigid, so as part of refactoring we need to dig them up, and <strong>replace them with flexible values</strong>.</p>
<h4>10. Refactor Units and Values</h4>
<p>To make maintenance and debugging easier in the future, and to avoid failures that can stem from using different units, such as <code>em</code> and <code>px</code>, simultaneously, we need to <strong>stick to coherent rules about how we use relative and absolute values</strong>.</p>
<p>If we used them inconsistently in the past, we need to convert them so that they can constitute a concise system</p>
<p>If we use too many similar colours on our site, it can also be a wise thing to <strong>rationalize the colour scheme</strong> by reducing the number of colours we employ. (Here&rsquo;s a post on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/website-color-scheme/">how to choose a website colour scheme in a practical manner</a>.)</p>
